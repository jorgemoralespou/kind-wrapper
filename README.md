# kind-wrapper
Wrapper script to make Kubernetes Kind more Developer friendly

This work is heavily inspired by [oc-cluster-wrapper](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/oc-cluster-wrapper/blob/master/README.adoc

It provides a basic workflow to create, start, stop, delete, list __named__ kubernetes clusters using [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
